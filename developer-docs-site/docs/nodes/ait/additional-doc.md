## Shutdown Nodes for Incentivized Testnet

Follow this instruction when you need to take down the validator node and cleanup the resources used by the node.

### Using source code

- Stop your node.
- Remove the data directory: `rm -rf <your-data-directory>`
- Remove the genesis blob file and waypoint
- Depends on if you want to reuse your node identity, you can choose to keep or delete the `private-keys.yaml`, `validator-identity.yaml`, `validator-full-node-identity.yaml` files.

### Using Docker

- Stop your node and remove the data volumes, `docker compose down --volumes`
- Remove the genesis blob file and waypoint
- Depends on if you want to reuse your node identity, you can choose to keep or delete the `private-keys.yaml`, `validator-identity.yaml`, `validator-full-node-identity.yaml` files.

### Using Terraform

- Stop your node and delete all the resources: `terraform destroy`


## Add Monitoring Components

Note: This is currently only supported using Terraform.

1. Set the `enable_monitoring` variable in your terraform module. For example:

    ```
    module "aptos-node" {
      ...
      enable_monitoring           = true
      utility_instance_num        = 3  # this will add one more utility instance to run monitoring component
    }
    ```

2. Apply the changes: `terraform apply`

3. You should see a new pod getting created. Run `kubectl get pods` to check.

4. Access the dashboard

    First, find the IP/DNS for the monitoring load balancer.

    ```
    kubectl get svc ${WORKSPACE}-mon-aptos-monitoring --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]}'
    ```

    You can access the dashboard on `http://<ip/DNS>`

## Staking with CLI

We now have a UI to support some staking operation, but in any case if you need to do operations not supported in UI, you can use CLI for it.

- Initialize CLI with your wallet private key or create new wallet

  ```
  aptos init --profile ait3-owner \
    --rest-url http://ait3.aptosdev.com
  ```

  You can either enter the private key from an existing wallet, or create new wallet address depends on your need.

- Initialize staking pool using CLI

  ```
  aptos stake initialize-stake-owner \
    --initial-stake-amount 100000000000000 \
    --operator-address <operator-address> \
    --voter-address <voter-address> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Transfer coin between accounts

  ```
  aptos account transfer \
    --account <operator-address> \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Switch operator

  ```
  aptos stake set-operator \
    --operator-address <new-operator-address> \ 
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Switch voter

  ```
  aptos stake set-delegated-voter \
    --voter-address <new-voter-address> \ 
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Add stake

  ```
  aptos stake add-stake \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Increase stake lockup

  ```
  aptos stake increase-lockup --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Unlock stake

  ```
  aptos stake unlock-stake \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```

- Withdraw stake

  ```
  aptos stake withdraw-stake \
    --amount <amount> \
    --profile ait3-owner
  ```
