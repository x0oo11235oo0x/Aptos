### Detailed steps

1. Read the Node Requirements. 

  :::tip

  Before you proceed, make sure that your hardware, storage and network resources satisfy the [Node Requirements](node-requirements.md).
  :::

2. Follow the detailed node installation steps provided in [Validators](/nodes/validator-node/validators) and deploy a validator node in the test mode.

  **Make sure to set your node in the Test mode.** Instructions are provided in the node installation sections. Test mode is required for Aptos Labs to do a health check on your node.

3. Come back to the Aptos Community page and register your node by clicking on Step 4: **NODE REGISTRATION** button.
   
  Provide the details of your validator node on this node registration screen, all the public key information you need is in the `~/$WORKSPACE/keys/public-keys.yaml` file (please don't enter anything from private keys).
  
    - OWNER KEY: the first wallet public key. From Settings -> Credentials
    - CONSENSUS KEY: consensus_public_key from `public-keys.yaml`
    - CONSENSUS POP: consensus_proof_of_possession from `public-keys.yaml`
    - ACCOUNT KEY: account_public_key from `public-keys.yaml`
    - VALIDATOR NETWORK KEY: validator_network_public_key from `public-keys.yaml`

4. Next, click on **VALIDATE NODE**. If your node passes healthcheck, you will be prompted to complete the identity verification process.

  The Aptos team will perform a node health check on your validator, using the [Node Health Checker](/nodes/node-health-checker). When Aptos confirms that your node is healthy, you will be asked to complete the KYC process. 

5. Wait for the selection announcement. If you are selected, the Aptos team will airdrop coins into your owner wallet address. If you do not see airdropped coins in your owner wallet, you were not selected.

6. If you are selected, then proceed to **Iniatilize staking pool** step.

### Detailed steps

:::caution Before you proceed
Proceed to the below steps only if you are selected to participate in the AIT-3.
:::

1. Confirm that you received the token from the Aptos team by checking the balance of your Petra wallet. Make sure you are connected to the AIT-3 network by click **Settings** → **Network**.

2. Create another wallet address for the voter. See [the above Step 4: Create the wallet using Petra](#create-wallet) to create a wallet on Petra. This step is optional. You can use the owner wallet account as voter wallet as well. However, the best practice is to have a dedicate voting account so that you do not need to access your owner key frequently for governance operations.

3. **Next you will stake and delegate.** 

  :::tip Read the Staking document

  Make sure you read the [Staking](/concepts/staking) documentation before proceeding further. 
  :::

  You will begin by initializing the staking pool and delegating to the operator and the voter. 

    1. From the Chrome browser, go to the [**Staking section** of the Aptos Governance page for AIT-3](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev/proposals/stake?network=ait3).
    2. Make sure the wallet is connected with your **owner** account.
    3. Provide the following inputs:
        1. Staking Amount: 100000000000000 (1 million Aptos coin with 8 decimals)
        2. Operator Address: The address of your operator account. This is the `operator_account_address` from the "operator.yaml" file, under `~/$WORKSPACE/$USERNAME` folder.
        3. Voter Address: The wallet address of your voter.
    4. Click **SUBMIT**. You will see a green snackbar indicating that the transaction is successful.

6. Next, as the owner, using Petra wallet, transfer 5000 coin each to your operator address and voter wallet address. Both the operator and the voter will use these funds to pay the gas fees while validating and voting.

7. Proceed to **Connect to AIT-3 and join the validator set**.
