# Building the Wallet Extension

This tutorial goes through how to build the wallet extension and how to use it with your dApp 
1. Install the wallet on Chrome
2. Wallet functionality
3. dApp Integration

## Step 1) Install the wallet on Chrome

1. Download the latest [wallet release](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases/) and unzip
2. Open a Chrome window and navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top right of the extension page
4. Hit **Load unpacked** and point it to the folder you just downloaded

Now you should see the Aptos wallet in your chrome extensions!

*Hint: Open your downloaded extensions by clicking the puzzle piece icon in your Chrome toolbar*

## Step 2) Wallet functionality
The wallet has implemented some of the basics of interacting with Aptos
- Create a new account
- Fund your account with test coins
- Send coins to another address
- Link to your account resources on Explorer
- View and create NFTs
- Select different networks

## Step 3) dApp Integration
dApps can make requests to the wallet from their website:
- `connect()`: prompts the user to allow connection from the dApp (*neccessary to make other requests*)
- `isConnected()`: returns if the dApp has established a connection with the wallet
- `account()`: gets the address of the account signed into the wallet
- `signAndSubmitTransaction(transaction)`: signs the given transaction and submits to chain
- `signTransaction(transaction)`: signs the given transaction and returns it to be submitted by the dApp
- `disconnect()`: Removes connection between dApp and wallet. Useful when the user wants to remove the connection.

### Usage

```typescript
// import transaction build from aptos sdk: https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk
import { BCS, TxnBuilderTypes } from 'aptos';

// Establish connection to the wallet
const result = await (window as any).aptos.connect()

// Check connection status of wallet
const status = await (window as any).aptos.isConnected()

// Gets the address of the account signed into the wallet
const accountAddress = await (window as any).aptos.account()

// Create a transaction
const transaction = {
    arguments: [address, '717'],
    function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
    type: 'entry_function_payload',
    type_arguments: ['0x1::aptos_coin::TestCoin'],
};

// Send transaction to the extension to be signed and submitted to chain
const response = await (window as any).aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(transaction)

// Send transaction to the extension to be signed and returns
const signedTransaction = await (window as any).aptos.signTransaction(transaction)

// Disconnect dApp from the wallet
await (window as any).aptos.disconnect(transaction)
```
