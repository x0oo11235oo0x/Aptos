# Staking

## Concept

:::tip
We strongly recommend that you read the consensus section of the [Life of a Transaction](/guides/basics-life-of-txn#consensus) before proceeding further. 
:::

In a distributed system like blockchain, executing a transaction is different from updating the state of the ledger and persisting the results in storage. An agreement, i.e., consensus, must be reached by a quorum of validators on the ordering of transactions and their execution results before the results are persisted in storage and the state of the ledger is updated. 

A validator can participate in the consensus process. However, the validator can acquire the voting power only when they stake, i.e., place their utility coin into escrow. To encourage validators to participate in the consensus process, each validator's vote weight is made proportionate to the amount of validator's stake. In exchange, the validator is rewarded in proportion to the amount of validator's stake. Hence, the performance of the network, i.e., consensus, is aligned with the validator's interest, i.e., rewards.   

However, when a validator stakes a very large amount of the utility coin into escrow, it gives the validator a vote weight large enough to control the consensus outcome. This gives the validator the power to threaten the security of the blockchain network, for example, by approving a fraudulent transaction. In the Aptos blockchain, there is a limit to the amount any validator can stake, to prevent any single validator from turning rogue. Furthermore, staking mitigates such security attacks because fradulent validators would have to be willing to forego rewards and even the valuation of their assets in order to attack the network.

In this way, staking in the Aptos blockchain drives the consensus while securing the blockchain network. 

The rest of this document presents how staking works on the Aptos blockchain.

### How a custodian can stake on Aptos

The Aptos staking module defines a capability that represents ownership. See [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/0daade4f734d1ba29a896b00d7ddde2249e87970/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/configs/stake.move#L85](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/0daade4f734d1ba29a896b00d7ddde2249e87970/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/configs/stake.move#L85).

This `OwnerCapability` resource can be used to control the stake pool. Three personas: the owner, the operator and the voter, are supported. Using this owner-operator-voter model, a custodian can assume the owner persona and stake on the Aptos blockchain, and participate in the Aptos governance. This model allows delegations and staking services to be built as the owner can provide funds to the validator and the voter personas.

This section describes how this works, using Bob and Alice in the example. 

#### Owner

The owner is the owner of the funds. For example, Bob creates an account on the Aptos blockchain. Now Bob has the `OwnerCapability` resource. Bob can assign his accountâ€™s operator address to the account of Alice, a trusted node operator, to appoint Alice as a validator.

As an owner:

- Bob owns the funds that will be used for staking.
- Only Bob can add or unlock or withdraw funds.
- Only Bob can extend the lockup period.
- Bob can change the node operator Alice to some other node operator anytime Bob wishes to do so.
- The reward will be deposited into Bob's (owner's) account.

#### Operator

A node operator is assigned by the fund owner to run the validator node. The two personas, the owner and the operator, can be two separate entities or the same. For example, Alice (operator) runs the validator node, operating at the behest of Bob, the fund owner.

As an operator:

- Alice has permissions only to join or leave the validator set.
- As a validator, Alice will perform the validating function.
- Alice has the permissions to change the consensus key and network addresses. The consensus key is used by Alice to participate in the validator consensus process, i.e., to vote and propose a block. Alice is allowed to change ("rotate") this key in case this key is compromised.
- However, Alice cannot move funds (unless Alice is the owner, i.e., Alice has the `OwnerCapability` resource.

#### Voter

An owner can designate a voter. This enables the voter to participate in governance. The voter  will use the voter key to sign the governance votes in the transactions.

:::tip Governance
This document describes staking. See [Governance](governance.md) for how to participate in the Aptos on-chain governance using the owner-voter model.

## Joining the validator set

Participating as a validator node on the Aptos network works like this: 

1. Run a validator node and configure the on-chain settings appropriately.
2. Deposit your Aptos coins funds as stake or have funds assigned by a staking service. The stake must be at least the minimum amount required.
3. Validate and gain rewards. 
4. Your stake will automatically be locked up for a fixed duration (set by the Aptos governance) and will be automatically renewed at expiration. You cannot withdraw any of your staked amount until your lockup period expires. See [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/00a234cc233b01f1a7e1680f81b72214a7af91a9/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/stake.move#L728](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/00a234cc233b01f1a7e1680f81b72214a7af91a9/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/stake.move#L728).

:::tip Joining the validator set
For step-by-step instructions on how to join the validator set, see: [Joining Validator Set](https://aptos.dev/nodes/ait/connect-to-testnet#joining-validator-set).
:::

### Minimum and maximum stake

You must stake the required minimum amount to join the validator set. Moreover, you can only stake up to the maximum stake amount. 

If at any time after joining the validator set, your current staked amount exceeds the maximum allowed stake (for example as the rewards are added to your staked amount), then your voting power and the rewards will be calculated only using the maximum allowed stake amount, and not your current staked amount. 

:::tip When the staked amount falls below minimum
If after joining the validator set, at the start of an epoch your stake drops below the minimum required amount, then you will be removed from the validator set. In the current version of the staking on the Aptos blockchain, there is no possibility of your stake dropping below the required minimum before the lockup period expires. Slashing is not currently supported.
:::

### Automatic lockup duration

When you join the validator set, your stake will automatically be locked up for a fixed duration that is set by the Aptos governance. 

### Automatic lockup renewal

When your lockup period expires, it will be automatically renewed, so that you can continue to validate and receive the rewards. 

### Unlocking your stake

You can request to unlock your stake at any time. However, your stake will only become withdrawable when your current lockup expires. This can be at most as long as the fixed lockup duration. 

:::tip Set by the governance

The lockup duration is decided by the Aptos governance, i.e., by the covenants that the Aptos community members vote on, and not by any special entity like the Aptos Labs. 
:::

## Epoch

An epoch in the Aptos blockchain is defined as a duration of time, in seconds, during which a number of blocks are voted on by the validators, the validator set is updated, and the rewards are distributed to the validators. 

:::tip
Currently an epoch on the Aptos blockchain is defined as 3600 seconds (one hour).
:::

### Triggers at the epoch start

:::tip
See [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/0daade4f734d1ba29a896b00d7ddde2249e87970/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/configs/stake.move#L862](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/0daade4f734d1ba29a896b00d7ddde2249e87970/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/configs/stake.move#L862) for the full code.
:::

At the start of each epoch, the following key events are triggered:

- Update the validator set by adding the pending active validators to the active validators set and by removing the pending inactive validators from the active validators set.
- Move any pending active stake to active stake, and any pending inactive stake to inactive stake.
- The staking pool's voting power in this new epoch is updated to the total active stake.
- Automatically renew a validator's lockup for the validators who will still be in the validator set in the next epoch.
- The voting power of each validator in the validator set is updated to be the corresponding staking pool's voting power.
- Rewards are distributed to the validators that participated in the previous epoch.

## Rewards

Rewards for staking are calculated by using `rewards_rate`, an annual percentage yield (APY), using the below two numbers:

- Your current total staked amount.
- Your remaining lock up time.

Rewards accrue as a compound interest on your current staked amount. 

:::tip Set by the governance

The `rewards_rate` is set by the Aptos governance.

:::

### Rewards paid every epoch

Rewards are paid every epoch. Any reward you earned at the end of current epoch is added to your staked amount. The reward at the end of the next epoch is calculated based on your increased staked amount (i.e., original staked amount plus the added reward), and so on.

### Rewards formula

See below the formula used to calculate rewards:

```
Reward = Maximum possible reward * (Remaining lockup / Maximum lockup) * (Number of successful votes / Total number of blocks in the current epoch)
```

where: 
```
rewards_rate = Maximum possible reward * (Remaining lockup / Maximum lockup)
```

Hence the `rewards_rate` will increase if you increase the remaining lockup period, eventually reaching the maximum when the remaining lockup period is the same as the maximum lockup period.

### Rewards use the remaining lockup period

As you can see above, the `rewards_rate` calculation formula is based on the remaining lockup period. For example, when you started with two years of lockup period, at the start your remaining lockup period is two years. After three days (`3*24`Â epochs) your remaining lockup period will be two years minus three days. 

If you do not extend your lock up period, then the remaining lockup period will decrease linearly over time, eventually becoming zero at the end of the two years. In this case, after the two years have elapsed your lockup period is zero and hence you will no longer receive any rewards.

### Rewards based on the voting performance

Your rewards calculation also uses your voting performance. Once you are in the validator set, you can vote in every epoch. The more consistently you vote, i.e., vote in every epoch, without any missed votes, you will receive additional voting power. This voting power is used to calculate your rewards. 

For every epoch, your voting performance is determined as follows:

- A running count of your missed votes, `validator_missed_votes_counts`, is maintained.
- The number of successful votes cast by you is calculated as:

```
Total number of successful votes = Total number of blocks in the epoch - Total number of your missed votes in the current epoch
```

Hence:

```
Reward = rewards_rate * (Number of successful votes / Total number of blocks in the current epoch)
```

:::tip
A validatorâ€™s missed votes count does not affect whether the validator is in the validator set or not. The missed votes count is used only to calculate the rewards, using the above formula.
:::

### Maintaining high rewards

You can prevent your rewards from gradually declining by regularly extending your lockup period. You can extend or renew your lockup period any time in a permissionless way.

For example, if you locked up for two years. A month from now you will receive a little less reward because your remaining lockup period will then be less (two years minus one month). However, if, before the month has fully elapsed, you extend your lockup period by one month to bring it back up to two years, then your month-end rewards will not decrease as they will be calculated based on the extended lockup period of two years.

:::tip
All your rewards are also subject to lockup period as they are added to the original staked amount. Hence you cannot withdraw your rewards until your lockup period has entirely expired.
:::

## Leaving the validator set

:::tip
See the Aptos Stake module in Move language here: [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/00a234cc233b01f1a7e1680f81b72214a7af91a9/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/stake.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/00a234cc233b01f1a7e1680f81b72214a7af91a9/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/stake.move)
:::

- At any time you can call the following sequence of functions to leave the validator set:
    - CallÂ `Stake::unlock`Â to unlock your stake amount, and 
    - Either callÂ `Stake::withdraw`Â to withdraw your staked amount at the next epoch, or callÂ `Stake::leave_validator_set`.

:::tip Leaving the validator set
For step-by-step instructions on how to leave the validator set, see: [Leaving Validator Set](https://aptos.dev/nodes/ait/connect-to-testnet#leaving-validator-set).
:::

## Rejoining the validator set

When you leave a validator set, you can rejoin by depositing the minimum required stake amount.
