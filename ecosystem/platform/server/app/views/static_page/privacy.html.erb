          This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how Aptos Labs ("Aptos,"

        <p>
          We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes,
          we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy and, in
          some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a

        <p>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
        <p>Information You Provide to Us</p>
        <p>
          The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you
          interact with Aptos and its Services. Aptos collects information that you
          provide us, information we obtain automatically when you use our Services
          and information from third-party sources and other organizations. The
          types of personal information we may collect from you include name, email
          address and any other information you choose to provide.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with Us</p>
        <p>
          Aptos may collect certain information automatically when you use our
          Services. Examples of this information include cookie identifiers,
          internet protocol (IP) address, mobile carrier, MAC address, user
          settings, mobile ad identifiers, Internet service provider, browser or
          device information, location information and metadata about information
          you provide Aptos. We may also automatically collect information
          pertaining to your use of our Services. Examples of this information may
          be related to your pages visited, links clicked, content interacted with,
          duration and frequency of your activities and other information about your
          use of our Services.
        </p>
        <p>Information We Collect from Other Sources</p>

          collect information about you from identity verification services, data
          analytics providers, and mailing list providers (if applicable).
          Additionally, our Services may allow you to provide information about your
          family or friends through our referral service, which allows you to
          forward or share certain information with Aptos. Please share information
          only for people that you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>
          We allow others to provide analytics services on our behalf across the web
          and in mobile apps. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device
          identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use

        <p>
          Aptos operates and engages service providers in various jurisdictions.
          Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your personal
          information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not
          provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your
          home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal
          information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions
          in which we process it.

          or other locally stored secret information. Aptos encrypts this information

        </p>
        <p>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
        <p>
          The California Consumer Privacy Act or "CCPA" (Cal. Civ. Code &sect;
          1798.100&nbsp;et seq.) affords consumers residing in California certain
          rights with respect to their personal information. If you are a California
          resident, this section applies to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the CCPA, you have the right to request to know: (i) the categories
          of personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months;
          (ii) the specific pieces of personal information we have about you; (iii)
          the categories of sources from which that personal information was
          collected; (iv) the categories of your personal information that we sold
          or disclosed in the last 12 months; (v) the categories of third parties to
          whom your personal information was sold or disclosed in the last 12
          months; and (vi) the purpose for collecting and selling your personal
          information. These rights are subject to limitations as described in the
          CCPA. Aptos may deny your request if we need to do so to comply with our
          legal rights or obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not discriminate against any consumer for exercising their CCPA
          rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized
          agent to make these requests on your behalf. To protect your information,
          we may need to verify your identity before processing your request,
          including by collecting additional information to verify your identity,
          such as government issued identification documents. Aptos will not fulfill
          your request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to
          reasonably verify you are the individual about whom we collected personal
          information. We will only use the personal information provided in the
          verification process to verify your identity or authority to make a
          request and to track and document request responses, unless you initially
          provided the information for another purpose. When we verify your
          agent&rsquo;s request, we may verify your identity and request a signed
          document from your agent that authorizes your agent to make the request on
          your behalf. To protect your personal information, we reserve the right to
          deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have
          been authorized by you to act on their behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
          the email in the &ldquo;Contact us&rdquo; section below.
        </p>
        <p>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE</p>
        <p>
          If you are located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the United
          Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the
          law regarding the processing of your personal data, and this section
          applies to you.
        </p>
        <p>Legal Basis for Processing</p>
        <p>
          When we process your personal data, we will do so in reliance on the
          following lawful bases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g.,
            processing payments for and providing the products and services you
            requested).
          </li>
          <li>
            When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to
            operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide,
            maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct data analytics,
            and communicate with you).
          </li>
          <li>
            To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your
            consents and track those who have opted out of communications).
          </li>
          <li>
            When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive
            communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for our
            processing of your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any
            time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data Retention</p>
        <p>
          We store other personal data for as long as necessary to carry out the
          purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate
          business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other
          compliance obligations.
        </p>
        <p>Data Subject Requests</p>
        <p>
          Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to request access to
          the personal data we hold about you and to receive your data in a portable
          format, the right to ask that your personal data be corrected or erased,
          and the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain
          processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please
          contact us at
          <a href="mailto:terms@aptoslabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terms@aptoslabs.com</a>.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Questions or Complaints</p>
        <p>
          If you have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are
          not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data
          Protection Authority where you reside. Contact details for your Data
