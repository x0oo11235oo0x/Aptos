        <p>Governing Law; Forum</p>
        <p>
          These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of
          the state of California in the United States of America without regard to
          its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction for all
          Disputes (defined below) will be in the county of Santa Clara, and you and
          Company each waive any objection to such jurisdiction and venue.
        </p>
        <p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
        <p>
          **Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
          arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Aptos and limits the manner in
          which you can seek relief from us. No class or representative actions or
          arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. **In addition,
          arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. **
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. (a) We each agree that any dispute,
          claim or controversy arising out of or relating to your participation in
          Testnet, use of the Aptos Services, or these Terms or the breach,
          termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof
          (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) will be resolved solely by binding,
          individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated
          action or proceeding. You and Aptos agree that the U.S. Federal
          Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms,
          and that you and Aptos are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive
          termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to the section above: (i) we both
          may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and
          (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
          from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation
          of our intellectual property rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be
          conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;)
          under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in
          effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at
          www.adr.org. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written
          Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as
          specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration
          at
          <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.adr.org</a>. The place of arbitration shall be in Palo Alto, CA. The language of
          arbitration shall be English. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall
          have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the
          interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this
          arbitration agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and
          arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won&rsquo;t seek
          to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for
          paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail
          in arbitration we&rsquo;ll pay all of our attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs
          and won&rsquo;t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in
          arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and
          expenses to the extent provided under Applicable Law.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided above, the
          arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any
          claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive
          relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
          the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s
          individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek
          public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary
          purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future
          injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must
          be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
          arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public
          injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any
          individual claims in arbitration.
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver. YOU AND APTOS AGREE THAT EACH
          MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
          CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
          REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp; Further, if the parties&rsquo; Dispute is
          resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another
          person&rsquo;s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over
          any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific
          provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute
          Resolution section shall be null and void.&nbsp; You and we both agree to
          waive the right to demand a trial by jury.
        </p>
        <p>
          (g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions above
          (&ldquo;Class Action Waiver&rdquo;), if an arbitrator or court of
          competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or
          unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.
        </p>
        <p>Assignment</p>
        <p>
          You may not sell, assign or transfer any of your rights, duties or
          obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any
          attempt by you to assign or transfer the Terms, without such consent, will
          be null and void.&nbsp; We reserve the right to assign or transfer these
          Terms or any of its rights, duties and obligations hereunder to any third
          party. &nbsp; Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to
          the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>General Terms</p>
        <p>
          Nothing herein shall constitute an employment, consultancy, joint venture,
          or partnership relationship between you and the Company.&nbsp; If any
          provision of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator
          or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to
          the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of the Terms will
          remain in full force and effect. &nbsp; These Terms reflect the entire
          agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
          supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements and
          understandings of the parties. The section titles in these Terms are for
          convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Use of the word

        <p>
          Waiver of Rights. Company&rsquo;s failure to enforce any right or
          provision of these Terms&nbsp; will not be considered a waiver of such
          right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be
          effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
          representative of Company. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms ,
          the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will
          be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
